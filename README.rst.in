NSIS Printer
============

The NSIS Printer plugin allows you to perform printer management from an NSIS
installer. It supports functionality such as enumerating printers, adding a new
printer, getting or setting the default printer, selecting a printer from the
list of available printers, and adding a redirected printer port (`RedMon 1.9
<http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/>`_ required).

Requirements
------------

The UNICODE plugin requires at least NSIS 3.0. The ASCII plugin should work
with NSIS 2.xx. I haven't tested (much) at all with NSIS 2.xx, so if there are
issues using the plugin with that version, let me know.

Build Requirements
------------------

VS2015 project files have been included for building with VisualStudio.
The following are the suggested requirements for building with GCC:

* `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_
* ``mingw64-i686-gcc-core`` (Cygwin package)
* ``mingw64-i686-runtime`` (Cygwin package; pulled in automatically by
  ``mingw64-i686-gcc-core``)
* ``mingw64-i686-headers`` (Cygwin package; pulled in automatically by
  ``mingw64-i686-gcc-core``)
* ``make`` (Cygwin package)
* ``unzip`` (Cygwin package; optional; for unpacking distribution)
* ``zip`` (Cygwin package; optional; for creating distribution packages (``make dist``))

Currently a patched version of Mingw-w64 5.0.0 is required for building. The
required patch has been included in the source distribution.

Cygwin Build Instructions
-------------------------

Install `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_ including the
``mingw64-i686-gcc-core`` compiler package, which should pull in
``mingw64-i686-runtime``.

Some required symbols may be missing from the ``mingw64-i686-runtime`` package
distributed with Cygwin so installing a patched version of the runtime may be
required in order to build the NSIS Printer DLL. As of this writing the version
of ``mingw64-i686-runtime`` included with Cygwin was 5.0 and installing a
patched version was necessary.

If no patching is required, building should be as simple as running:

  ``make``

If patching is required, download the `Mingw-w64 sources`_ and unpack the
downloaded files somewhere within your Cygwin ``/home/$USER`` directory.  Copy
the supplied patch, ``mingw64-runtime-print-symbols.patch``, to the newly
unpacked ``mingw-w64-v5.0.0`` directory and apply it using:

 ``patch -p1 < mingw64-runtime-print-symbols.patch``

Then build the mingw64 runtime using the following commands from within the
same directory:

 ``./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/opt/mingw-w64-v5.0.0``

 ``make``

 ``make install``

After the patched mingw-w64 runtime has been installed, return to the
nsisprinter directory and execute the command:

 ``make LDFLAGS=-L/opt/mingw-w64-v5.0.0/lib``

Example Usage
-------------

The following examples provide a basic idea of how to use this plugin. All
examples assume the inclusion of the ``logiclib.nsh`` header.

EnumPrinters Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  ${EnumPrinters} $R0
  ${If} $R0 == -1
    Pop $R0
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
    Abort
  ${EndIf}

  DetailPrint "Available Printers:"
  ${DoWhile} $R0 > 0
    Pop $0
    DetailPrint "  $0"
    IntOp $R0 $R0 - 1
  ${Loop}

AddPrinterDriver Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  ; In Main Section
  SetOutPath "$PLUGINSDIR"
  File /r "Driver Name"

  ; In -Post Section
  ${AddPrinterDriver} "$PLUGINSDIR\Driver Name\DRIVER.INI" $R0
  ${If} $R0 == 0
    Pop $1
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
  ${EndIf}

AddPrinter Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  ${AddPrinter} "Printer Name" "RPT1" "Driver Name" $R0
  ${If} $R0 == 0
    Pop $R0
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
    Abort
  ${EndIf}

Driver INI File Documentation
-----------------------------

The driver INI file describes the files to be installed using the
``AddPinterDriver`` function. It should be included in the same directory as
the driver files it describes. The only required section it has is
``[driver]``. The following are valid settings within the section.

- ``version``: This must be set to ``3``.

- ``name``: Install the printer driver under this name. This is the name used
  to reference the driver when using fuctions such as ``AddPrinter``.

- ``environment``: Must be ``Windows NT x86`` or  ``Windows x64`` depending on
  whether the driver is for a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture respectively.

- ``driver``: The name of the drivers main DLL file.

- ``datafile``: The data file used by the driver.

- ``configfile``: The DLL that presents the driver configuration UI.

- ``helpfile``: The help file for the driver.

- ``depfiles``: Additional files used by the driver separated by
  semi-colons (;).

Driver INI Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is an example of a driver INI file.  The ``depfiles`` setting
should be on a single line with items separated by semi-colons (;). It has been
split across lines here for readability.

  version=3
