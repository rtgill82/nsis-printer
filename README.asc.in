= NSIS Printer
Robert Gill <rtgill82@gmail.com>

The *NSIS Printer* plugin allows you to perform printer management from an NSIS
installer. It supports functionality such as enumerating printers, adding a new
printer, getting or setting the default printer, selecting a printer from the
list of available printers, and adding a redirected printer port
(http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/[RedMon 1.9] required).


== Requirements

The UNICODE plugin requires at least NSIS 3.0. The ASCII plugin should work
with NSIS 2.xx. I haven't tested (much) at all with NSIS 2.xx, so if there are
issues using the plugin with that version, let me know.


== Example Usage

The following examples provide a basic idea of how to use this plugin. All
examples assume the inclusion of the `logiclib.nsh` header.


=== EnumPrinters Example

[source,nsis]
----
  ${EnumPrinters} $R0
  ${If} $R0 == -1
    Pop $R0
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
    Abort
  ${EndIf}

  DetailPrint "Available Printers:"
  ${DoWhile} $R0 > 0
    Pop $0
    DetailPrint "  $0"
    IntOp $R0 $R0 - 1
  ${Loop}
----


=== AddPrinterDriver Example

[source,nsis]
----
  ; In Main Section
  SetOutPath "$PLUGINSDIR"
  File /r "Driver Name"

  ; In -Post Section
  ${AddPrinterDriver} "$PLUGINSDIR\Driver Name\DRIVER.INI" $R0
  ${If} $R0 == 0
    Pop $1
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
  ${EndIf}
----


=== AddPrinter Example

[source,nsis]
----
  ${AddPrinter} "Printer Name" "RPT1" "Driver Name" $R0
  ${If} $R0 == 0
    Pop $R0
    DetailPrint "Error: $R0"
    Abort
  ${EndIf}
----

== Driver INI File Documentation

The driver INI file describes the files to be installed using the
`AddPinterDriver` function. It should be included in the same directory as the
driver files it describes. The only required section it has is `[driver]`. The
following are valid settings within the section.

- `version`: This must be set to `3`.

- `name`: Install the printer driver under this name. This is the name used
  to reference the driver when using fuctions such as `AddPrinter`.

- `environment`: Must be `Windows NT x86` or  `Windows x64` depending on
  whether the driver is for a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture respectively.

- `driver`: The name of the drivers main DLL file.

- `datafile`: The data file used by the driver.

- `configfile`: The DLL that presents the driver configuration UI.

- `helpfile`: The help file for the driver.

- `depfiles`: Additional files used by the driver separated by
  semi-colons (;).


== Driver INI Example

The following is an example of a driver INI file.  The `depfiles` setting
should be on a single line with items separated by semi-colons (;). It has been
split across lines here for readability.

== Build Requirements

VS2019 project files have been included for building with VisualStudio.
The following are the requirements for building with GCC:

* https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin]
* `mingw64-i686-gcc-core` (Cygwin package)
* `make` (Cygwin package)
* `unzip` or `p7zip` (Cygwin package; optional; for unpacking distribution)
* `p7zip` (Cygwin package; optional; for creating distribution packages (`make dist`))


== Cygwin Build Instructions

Install https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] including the `mingw64-i686-gcc-core`
compiler package, which should pull in `mingw64-i686-runtime`.

Then building should be as simple as running:

  make
